# 1. Introduction
All the RF test items are based on complying to the regional certification. The test items can be classified to transmit(Tx) and receive(Rx). The RF test can be excuted in conduct mode or radiation mode. The conduct test is done with instruments and directly connected DUT to instruments by RF cable, thus the antenna is removed and isolated from RF path, the RF signal transports in inner conductor between DUT and instruments, and be shielded by outer conductor of the RF cable. The radiation test will deploy the antenna, the RF signal transports in the air, thus the environment around the test site impacts the test results very much. Usually the radiation test is performed in an anechoic chamber which simulate the free space and reduce the impact of nvironment. Although the test modes are different, the test instruments setting and certification limits are kept the same.
For the RF testing, it will deploys instruments such as spectrum analyzer(for Tx test) and signal analyzer(for Tx and Rx test). Some of the intruments settings are defined in the RF regulation. In this section, it will describe how to setup test platform and do the test items in conduct mode. And it will also introduce the radiation test environments setup, but will not introduce the test items in detail since it will be same with conduct test mode.
# 2. Tx test items
In this chapter, it will introduces FCC and CE regulations for both sub-GHz and 2.4GHz frequency bands.
